AFDX designer project.
This repo includes the following components:
- AFDX GUI based on python qt
- Verifier of network configuration
- Response time analyzer based on Trajectory Approach (modified a bit to get faster calculations)
- Algorithm of designing virtual links configurations by given data flows with all constraints satisfaction


To Run GUI use python2.
You can also use this algorithm without GUI.

Algo doesn't remove unused links. You can do it using your hands.
